# cpu-tutorial

Exercises to guide you through building your own CPU, from scratch, in verilog

## pre-requisites

- you should already have a grounding in verilog
    - one way to do this is to work your way through the questions at https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page
    - I didn't finish these, but I did many of them; you can see the ones I did personally at https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Special:VlgStats/3D7115FE8A440C29
    - note: I'm not affiliated, I just found it was quite useful for me
- to learn verilog, hdlbits isn't enough: this just provides short-term validation, practice, and dopamine-stimulation that you are in fact learning
    - one resource that is quite useful for learning is https://www.doulos.com/knowhow/verilog/ (note: I'm not affiliated, I just found it worked well for mw)
    - you can google around the web for other resources as you go
- you'll need to install some simulators and synthesizers. I use:
     - [iverilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
     - [verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/)
     - [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)
- you'll need a text editor, or development environment. I use the following:
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- know at least one programming language you can use to write host-side code, such as assemblers
    - python or C++ are both ok. I used python initially

Note that *all* the above resources can be used without needing to buy licenses or similar.
